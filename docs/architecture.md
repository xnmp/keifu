# Architecture Decisions

## Panel Focus System (2026-03-25)

**Decision:** `FocusedPanel` is a field on `App`, not a new `AppMode` variant.

**Why:** The existing `FileSelect` and `FileDiff` modes work as overlays on top of the graph view. If we made panel focus a mode, we'd need to handle mode transitions between `FileSelect`, `FileDiff`, and each panel focus state — an explosion of combinations. Keeping focus as a field means modes and panel focus are orthogonal.

**How it works:** The keybinding router checks both `app.mode` and `app.focused_panel` to determine which key handler to use. In `AppMode::Normal`, keys are routed to `handle_graph_action`, `handle_files_action`, or `handle_commit_detail_action` based on focused panel. Other modes (Help, Input, Confirm, CommitMenu, FileSelect, FileDiff) handle their own keys regardless of focused panel.

## Text Editor Persistence (2026-03-25)

**Decision:** `TextEditor` lives on `App.commit_editor`, not inside an `AppMode` variant.

**Why:** The commit message must survive focus changes. If the user types a message, switches to the files panel to stage files, then switches back, the message should still be there. Storing it in a mode variant would lose it on mode transitions.

**Caveat:** `editing_commit_message: bool` is a separate flag that controls whether key events route to the editor. This flag is cleared when focus leaves the commit panel or when Esc is pressed.

## Quick Diff Cache (2026-03-25)

**Decision:** Two-tier diff caching: `quick_diff_cache` (synchronous, file names only) and `diff_cache` (async, with line stats).

**Why:** The async diff computation has a 120ms debounce + computation time. During this window, showing "Loading..." is a poor UX when we can show file names instantly. The quick diff uses `diff.deltas()` without computing patches, which is nearly instant.

**How it works:**
1. When `sync_selected_diff_target` detects a target change, it synchronously computes the quick file list
2. The UI calls `cached_diff_or_quick()` which returns the full diff if available, otherwise the quick cache
3. When line stats are still loading, file entries show "..." instead of +X/-Y

## Clipboard via Shell Commands (2026-03-25)

**Decision:** Use shell commands (`xclip`, `xsel`, `wl-copy`, `pbcopy`) for clipboard instead of a Rust crate.

**Why:** The `arboard` and `cli-clipboard` crates both pull in `openssl-sys` which fails to build with vendored OpenSSL on some systems (assembler errors with newer toolchains). Shell commands work universally and add zero dependencies.

**Update (2026-07-19):** Added an OSC 52 fallback (`tui::copy_to_clipboard_osc52`) for when no shell clipboard tool is found — it emits `\x1b]52;c;<base64>\x07` directly to stdout, which works headless/over SSH with no external binary. It's a fallback rather than the primary path because not every terminal emulator supports OSC 52 (unlike xclip/wl-copy, which either work or clearly don't). The base64 encoder is a small hand-rolled function (no new dependency — `base64` only appears in `Cargo.lock` transitively). Payloads are capped at 100,000 base64 chars (matching common terminal limits, e.g. xterm's default) and truncated on a 3-byte boundary if oversized; callers surface `" (via OSC 52[, truncated])"` in the existing status-line message when the fallback fires.

## StageStatus Tracking (2026-03-25)

**Decision:** `FileDiffInfo.stage_status` is set during `from_working_tree()` BEFORE the merge scan, and separate `staged_files`/`unstaged_files` vectors are stored alongside the merged `files` list.

**Why:** The merge scan combines files that appear in both staged and unstaged diffs (e.g., partially staged files). Keeping pre-merge copies preserves the staged/unstaged distinction for the UI. The merged `files` list is still used for total counts and the flat file view for committed changes.

## Deferred Filesystem Watcher (2026-07-13)

**Decision:** `FsWatcher` is constructed on a background thread (`FsWatcher::spawn`) and installed into `App.watcher` by `poll_fs_watcher` once ready, instead of synchronously in `App::new`.

**Why:** Registering a recursive inotify watch walks every directory in the working tree (including `node_modules`, `target`, `.git/objects`). Profiling showed this was 91–94% of pre-first-frame time — 142ms on a small repo, ~500ms on a 135k-file repo. The watcher only drives auto-refresh; nothing about the first frame needs it. Events during the sub-second construction window are covered by the auto-refresh timer.

**Also:** the OSC-11 terminal background-color query (blocking, typically 5–15ms, worst case 100ms) runs on a parallel thread during `App::new` and is joined before `tui::init`, so it can't race the TUI's raw-mode handling.

**Future:** the watch could be scoped to `.git/{refs,HEAD,...}` + non-ignored directories, cutting inotify watch counts 10–100× (relevant near `fs.inotify.max_user_watches`).

## Diff Viewer File List = Display Order (2026-07-13)

**Decision:** The `FileDiff` viewer's `file_list` snapshot is built from the files pane's display items (`display_file_list()`), not from the deduplicated `diff.files`.

**Why:** `file_index` is computed in display space (a partially-staged file appears once in the staged section and once in the unstaged section). Mixing display-space indices with the shorter deduplicated list caused an out-of-bounds panic in PrevFile navigation. One index space everywhere: display order.

## UI Render Pass May Write Layout State Back to App (2026-07-13)

**Documented exception:** `ui/*` is otherwise stateless over `&App`, but `draw()` writes render-time layout facts back to `App` (`sync_file_list_cache`, `diff_viewport_*`, commit-detail scroll clamps) because terminal size is only known at render time. This is intentional; new widgets should not add other kinds of mutation.

## Merge-Conflict Awareness (2026-07-13)

**Decision:** A conflict is a first-class *outcome*, not an error. `merge_branch` / `rebase_branch` / `cherry_pick` / `revert_commit` return `OpOutcome::{Completed, Conflicts{count}}` and deliberately leave the repo mid-operation (conflicted index + MERGE_HEAD / REBASE_HEAD / CHERRY_PICK_HEAD / REVERT_HEAD). Callers (`app/confirm_actions.rs`) route conflicts to a guided "resolve then Continue / Abort" flow via `App::handle_op_outcome`, not the raw error popup.

**In-progress state** comes from `GitRepository::operation_state()` (`OperationState`, mapped from `git2::RepositoryState`) and `conflicted_count()` (`Status::CONFLICTED`), both refreshed in `refresh()`. `get_working_tree_status` must include `CONFLICTED` — otherwise a merge whose only change is the conflicted file leaves the uncommitted node (and its files) invisible.

**Conflicted files** carry `StageStatus::Conflicted`. An unmerged path surfaces in *both* the HEAD→index and index→workdir diffs, so both `from_working_tree` and `quick_file_list_for_working_tree` drop it from the staged side and keep one entry on the unstaged side; the files pane groups those into a "Merge Changes" section rendered first (marker `!`).

**Gotcha — rebase abort/continue must use libgit2, not the CLI.** `rebase_branch` starts the rebase via `repo.rebase()`, which writes a `.git/rebase-merge` layout *without* a `git-rebase-todo`. `git rebase --continue/--abort` then fails with "could not open '.git/rebase-merge/git-rebase-todo'". So `abort_operation`/`continue_operation` special-case `Rebase` to `Rebase::abort()` / `open_rebase()+commit()+finish()`. Merge/cherry-pick/revert use `git <op> --abort|--continue` (libgit2's merge writes a CLI-compatible MERGE_HEAD; cherry-pick/revert are CLI-driven throughout). Continue runs with `GIT_EDITOR=true` so it never blocks the TUI.

**Keys (files pane):** `o` accept ours, `t` accept theirs, `c` continue, `A` abort (behind the Confirm dialog).

## Hunk-Level Staging Model (2026-07-13)

**Decision:** The FileDiff viewer for uncommitted changes shows the *combined*
`git diff HEAD` diff (`diff_tree_to_workdir_with_index`). Hunk operations
synthesise a minimal single-hunk unified diff for the hunk under the cursor and
shell out to `git apply`: stage → `--cached`, unstage → `--cached -R`, discard
→ `-R` (working tree, routed through Confirm). Direction is chosen by the key
(`s`/`u`/`x`), not inferred from the hunk, because the combined view cannot tell
a staged hunk from an unstaged one.

**Why patch synthesis, not libgit2 apply:** libgit2 has no hunk-scoped index
apply. Patches are built by `git/patch.rs::extract_hunk_from_working_tree` from
libgit2's *raw* line bytes (not the display `DiffLineContent`, whose content is
trimmed and would lose CRLF), then rendered by the pure `render_hunk_patch`. A
line whose raw content lacks a trailing `\n` yields the `\ No newline at end of
file` marker; CRLF endings pass through verbatim.

**Correctness boundary:** `git apply` validates the patch against the target
(index or worktree) and fails loudly rather than corrupting state. In the common
case (a file with only unstaged changes, so index == HEAD) every direction
applies cleanly. Untracked files have no index/HEAD entry, so stage-hunk falls
back to a whole-file `git add` (the combined diff is a single all-additions hunk
== the whole file) and unstage/discard-hunk defer to the files pane.

## Pixel-Rendered Graph (2026-07-18)

**Decision:** Draw graph lines as transparent RGBA images via a terminal
graphics protocol, overlaid on top of a blanked graph column, instead of
box-drawing glyphs. Off by default-to-Unicode unless a protocol is detected.

**Why:** Box-drawing glyphs leave visible gaps between rows (a `│` never quite
touches the cell above/below, `●` is barely wider than the line), so the graph
reads as dashed rather than continuous. Rasterizing each row lets lines touch
cell edges exactly and dots be visibly wider than lines, matching VSCode Git
Graph.

**How it works:**
1. `PixelGraphState::new()` (`ui/graph_pixels.rs`) calls
   `ratatui_image::Picker::from_query_stdio()` once at startup — after raw mode
   is enabled but before the event loop polls, so crossterm's reader doesn't eat
   the terminal's query reply. It returns `None` (→ Unicode fallback) unless a
   *transparency-preserving* protocol is detected: only **Kitty** and **iTerm2**
   are whitelisted. Halfblocks isn't graphics, and Sixel's encoder drops the
   alpha channel (`to_rgb8`), which would paint black boxes over the selection
   highlight. `config.ui.graph_renderer` gates this: `Unicode` skips detection
   entirely; `Auto`/`Pixel` attempt it.
2. Each visible row is described by a `RowSpec` — a fully-resolved, hashable list
   of `PixelCell`s (shape + concrete RGB, resolved from the theme; commit dots
   carry `connect_up`/`connect_down` bits computed from whether the adjacent
   *visible* rows' cells touch the shared edge). `build_row_spec` takes the
   previous/next visible nodes (adjacency follows `visible_commit_indices` in
   filtered mode, not raw node order).
3. `rasterize_row` is a pure, deterministic function drawing lines (distance-based
   anti-aliasing), quadratic-bezier arcs for branch/merge corners, and commit
   dots (filled disc / ring for HEAD / hollow for uncommitted) onto a transparent
   canvas at exactly `n_cells * cell_w × cell_h` pixels.
   Each spec's cells are truncated to the width the overlay will draw, because
   the iTerm2/Sixel fixed protocols render *nothing* when the protocol is wider
   than its render area (only Kitty crops) — the cached protocol's cell-width
   must equal the overlay rect.
4. Protocols are cached in a `HashMap<RowSpec, Protocol>`; on overflow past 1024
   entries the cache is pruned down to the current frame's spec set (not cleared
   wholesale), so the hot set survives. Protocol-creation failures are counted;
   after 3 in a row the state is poisoned and the app permanently falls back to
   Unicode instead of re-encoding every frame.
5. In `ui/mod.rs::draw`, a pre-pass (needs `&mut app`) builds the row specs —
   cached on `App` keyed by `(graph_generation, commit_filter, width)` and
   rebuilt only when one changes — then `sync_frame` transmits/evicts protocols
   before the graph widget's immutable borrow. In pixel mode `render_graph_line`
   emits blank spaces of the exact same width as the glyphs (HEAD star included)
   so text layout is unchanged, then `overlay_pixel_graph` renders each row's
   `Image` at the shared `GRAPH_LEADING_COLUMNS` x-offset using the scroll offset
   the list widget wrote back into `graph_list_state`. Both the space-emitter and
   the overlay share `visible_nodes()` for row ordering and the same offset
   constant, so they can't drift. Images are transparent so the list's selection
   highlight shows through.

**Color mapping:** theme lane colors may be named ANSI variants, not RGB.
`color_to_rgb` maps named/Indexed colors to real RGB (standard xterm values,
xterm-256 palette formula) so rasterization has concrete colors.

**S-curve lane transitions (2026-07-19).** Lane-to-lane shifts render as long,
gentle VSCode-style S-curves rather than a straight horizontal run + a tight
rounded corner. `draw_cells` runs in two phases:
1. `transition_curves` — a pure, row-local scan of `spec.cells` — reconstructs
   each maximal horizontal-family run into cubic beziers. A run's endpoints are
   its corners/Tees plus any flanking commit dot, classified as *hubs*
   (horizontal tangent, at row mid-height: a dot, or a `Tee{Right,Left}` arm) or
   *spokes* (vertical tangent, at a row edge: `Merge*` up, `Branch*` down,
   `TeeUp` risers). One cubic is drawn from the primary hub to each spoke
   (branch/merge = the 2-endpoint case → one curve; a fork connector `├─┴─╯`
   fans several), each eased along its end tangents by `CURVE_EASE`. Each spoke
   curve carries the spoke's own color/dim, so a multi-color fork connector
   colors each arm correctly.
2. The straight verticals (lane pipes, `HorizontalPipe`'s crossed pipe, `Tee`
   trunks, commit connectors) and the dots/stars draw *on top* of the curves, so
   a crossed pipe stays visible over the sweep and dims independently.

Curve endpoints are exact lane centers on row edges (spokes) or dot centers
(hubs), so rows still tile seamlessly (no new gap class) and each curve meets
the dot it belongs to (subsumes the earlier horizontal-overshoot fix). Because
`transition_curves` is pure over the cells, drawing stays a deterministic
function of the `RowSpec`, so the protocol cache stays correct. Unicode mode is
unchanged (box glyphs can't curve).

**Uncommitted connector survives the commit filter (2026-07-19).** The synthetic
uncommitted-changes node always passes the commit filter, and its connector is
wired to HEAD at graph-build time. If HEAD's own message missed the filter it
was hidden, orphaning the connector into a dangling grey stub beneath the top
marker. `node_passes_commit_filter` now also keeps the HEAD row whenever an
uncommitted node exists (`has_uncommitted_node`, O(1) — the uncommitted node is
always at index 0), so the connector always terminates at the star.
